##Algorithms
Search − Algorithm to search an item in a datastructure.
Sort − Algorithm to sort items in certain order
Insert − Algorithm to insert item in a datastructure
Update − Algorithm to update an existing item in a data structure
Delete − Algorithm to delete an existing item from a data structure


##Design Patterns

###Creational Patterns
These design patterns provides way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new opreator. This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.

1. Singleton Pattern
2. Factory Pattern
3. Facade Pattern
4. Abstract Factory Pattern

###Structural Patterns
These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.

1. Adapter Pattern
2. Bridge Pattern
3. Decorator Pattern
4. MVC Pattern
5. DAO Pattern

###Behavioral Patterns
These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.

1. Observer Pattern
2. Strategy Pattern
3. Chain of Responsibility

##SOLID Principles

1. SRP The Single Responsibility Principle A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
2. OCP	The Open Closed Principle	You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying it.
3. LSP	The Liskov Substitution Principle	Child classes must be able to override parent classes references without any problems.
4. ISP	The Interface Segregation Principle	Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific. Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they don't use.
5. DIP	The Dependency Inversion Principle

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
